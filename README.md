# subsampling


This repo contains 3 folders: (a) Data, which contains copies of the scraped [KEEL datasets](https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/imbalanced.php) used in our analysis; (b) Figures, which contains the figures that we generated and used in our manuscript; and (c) Code, which contains the code used for our experimentations ([result_by_IR.R](https://github.com/fmegahed/subsampling/blob/main/Code/result_by_IR.R)), analyzing the experiment ([result_by_anova.R](https://github.com/fmegahed/subsampling/blob/main/Code/result_by_anova.R)), and used to generate Figure 1 ([subsampling_example.R](https://github.com/fmegahed/subsampling/blob/main/Code/subsampling_example.R)). 


Once our manuscript is finalized, we will also provide a full markdown of our code and analysis.
